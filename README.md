### Hi! Name's Pietro Cardile 

I'm a computer science student at Universit√† degli studi di Bari 'Aldo Moro'.

I'm currently working on a Flutter project for studying in a easier way, but I'm also working on different many projects! Such as an Arduino car (and drone :P), many 3D scenes with Blender and so on.

Below you can see my Github & Wakatime stats, see you on the other side! (At the bottom of this page)

I'm looking for friends for making videogames together on Unreal Engine (but also on Unity, if required!) in a friendly and non-job environment.
I really love creating games and obviously I play many games, such as Cyberpunk 2077, Outlast, Minecraft, Call of Duty, Detroit become human and more.
For me, games are PURE ART in all of its way of being expressed! Can't wait for my dreams to become truth.

If you'd like to contact me don't hesitate! I'm open new projects and discovers.
You can contact me on Instagram @theonlywhoknocks and by email pietrocardile893@gmail.com.
